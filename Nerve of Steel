"""
This is a program for the party game Nerve of Steel. This is In-class Exercise 4 for MGTC28.
"""

# The game Nerve of Steel goes as follows:
# 1. The program displays 'Players Stand'
# 2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.
# 3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins."  Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.

import time # this function will require a time function because the game requires a timer.
import random # this function will require a random function because the timer sleeps for a random number of seconds between 5 and 25.

def Play_Nerve_of_Steel(): # Here we are creating the function for the Nerve of Steel game.
    
    print("Players Stand") # As stated earlier, the first part of the game is the program telling the players to stand.
    
    random_timer = random.randint(5,25) # We are setting the random number of seconds after which the timer goes off.
    time.sleep(random_timer) # We are establishing the timer that will go off after anywhere between 5 and 25 seconds.
    
    print("Times up. Last to sit down wins") # This text indicates that the players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.
    
    
# Now that we've created a program for the game, we can run the function to play.
